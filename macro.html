            <h2>Zone Theory and Guidelines</h2>
            <p class="p1">Zone Theory is our hypothesis on how Apex generates zones and our understanding of zones currently through trial and error and data gathered from 3 years of Competitive games.</p>
                <p class="p1">1. The endzone for a game is chosen at the start of the game, the rest of the rings are built up in reverse from the endzone from Ring 6 to 1.</p>
                <p class="p1">2. For any Ring, more than 50% of the ring will be playable space. Rings pull away from mountains, out of bounds areas, and PvE areas. These areas can influence ring pulls and generally make prediction harder.</p>
                <p class="p1">3. There are a finite number of endzones and they are not evenly spread around the map. They are clustered. Use the clustering of zones to weight predictions.</p>
                <p class="p1">4. Zones typically don't end in buildings as to avoid heal offs. Most heal off zones have been removed.</p>
                <p class="p1">5. When the endzone is further from the center of the map, it's more likely to continue pulling that direction. Think zones that end in Trials, Thermal, Lava City, Dome, Climatizer. When it's closer to the center of the map, there's more variance in the zones. Think Harvester, Frag, Landslide, Lava Siphon. When the zone is pulling more towards the center and the consequent zones are hard pulling to the edge of the first or second ring, it's likely to counterpull and not continue pulling to the same edge.</p>
                <p class="p1">6. When the edge of the next zone is touching the edge of the current zone, it's likely to continue pulling that direction and not center up unless there's a counterpull. If there is a gap, no matter how small, between the edges of the current zone and next, it will pull more towards the center.</p>
                <p class="p1">7. There are "random" zonepulls, counterpulls, that can drastically affect the endzone. These are not entirely random however as the zone can still be predicted, it's simply a matter of when this occurs and the likelihood of it happening.</p>
                <p class="p1">8. The zone algorithm is the same for all the maps.</p>
                <p class="p1">9. If the vector lands on invalid zone space expect a counterpull or try the longer of the two primary vectors. Generally if the vector result lands on invalid zone space try a different vector combination.</p>

            <h2>Braydon's Teardrop Theory</h2>
            <p class="p2">This is without a doubt the current best theory on how to win endgame.</p>
            <p class="p2">Emphasizes heavily on positioning and decisiveness. Works in CC, PL, and ON LAN.</p>
            <p class="p2">Full understanding and implementation differentiates CC and PL IGLs to PL and LAN competitors.</p>
