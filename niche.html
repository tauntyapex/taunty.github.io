            <h1>Out of Bounds Spots + VODs(OOB)</h1>
            <p class="p1">Out of Bounds or better known as OOB is using unplayable area, such as top of mountains or the roof-tops of Monument to fly to via Valkyrie Skyward Dive or using Redeployable Balloons to catch the enemy by suprise. Previously this was used to escape teams and quickly heal before re-popping another Valkyrie Skyward Dive and getting deeper into zone.</p>
            <p class="p1">At the start of Season 13 (May 10th, 2022), OOB was completely nerfed. While out of bounds, players were now unable to 1. use abilities 2. shoot, throw nades, or heal/use survival items and 3. any passive ability. This completely nerfed sitting on-top of mountains and buildings and now OOB is used as a repositioning tool. OOB timer also NO LONGER RESET.</p>
