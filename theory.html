            <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
                <p class="p2">&#x2022;With the class update in Season 17, a general rule is that every team needs a Beacon scan (either Ring Console or Map Room Scan) character, a vertical movement character such as Horizon, and a defensive character such as Catalyst.</p>
                <p class="p2">&#x2022;If running a comp with a character with a large hitbox such as Caustic or Gibby, a character that can move them around, such as Wraith, Valk, or Pathfinder, is needed.</p>
                <p class="p2">&#x2022;Zone teams favor characters that provide team support to the entire team such as Loba (ammo and loot), Wattson (Shields), Lifeline (Armor and attachments).</p>
                <p class="p2">&#x2022;Majority Edge/Hybrid teams favor characters that provide fighting abilities such as Bangalore (rotational smokes/rolling thunder), Gibby (Bubble/Defensive Bombardment), Maggie (Riot Drill/Wrecking Ball).</p>
                <p class="p2">&#x2022;Characters who do not provide a team fighting ability, team support ability, or team movement ability such as Mirage, Revenant, Octane are no advised to be played. </p>
                <p class="p2">&#x2022;Niche characters are those who provide both team and fighting abilities or provide a very different set of abilities such as Fuse, Wraith, and Newcastle. Not bad picks, but hard to work around and better options exist.</p>
                <p class="p2">&#x2022;Characters like Vantage, Ash, Ballistic are all "Niche" characters, but vastly outmatched by their counter-parts like Seer, Wraith, Maggie.</p>
