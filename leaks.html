            <h1>Taunty - Leaks</h1>
            <p class="p1">This section will include leaks. Some of this should be taken with a grain of salt. Leaks will be updated when confirmed, disproven, or made official by @playapex.</p>

            <p class="p1">[CONFIRMED]Large Stormpoint change that will affect southern side of the map. RIP Gale, Fish Farms, Launch Pad, and Shipfall.</p>
            <p class="p1">The door left-side of the firing range is a mystery... Contains Octane and Lifeline lore.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Leaks</h2>
            <p class="p1">I myself know how to datamine and get models, but overall the cost-to-reward ratio of datamining isn't as useful as loot pathing, data collecting, and going into the game and finding spots, hence why I don't do my own leaks.</p1>
            <p class="p1">If you are interested in a banner or thumbnail using 3D models, message me on Discord: Taunty#5810 where I can make you one. Looking to do a few for free to learn.</p>
